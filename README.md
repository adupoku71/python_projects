## A list of beginner python projects to test my python skills

### Madlibs

Takes some random words from the user using the `input("")` function and putting them
into a madlib.
I made use of the `f"{variable} some text {variable2}"` string formatting technique
to achieve said results.

### Guess number

Made use of the `random library` to generate a random number.
The user is made to make a guess, receives a congratulatory message
if the number is guessed right and asked to guess again if otherwise.
The user has only 3 attempts.
Also used a `try/except` block to check if user entered an integer.
